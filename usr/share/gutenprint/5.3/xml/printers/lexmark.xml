   XML description of printers known to libgutenprint
   You can add additional printers here, but the underlying driver has
   to know about the model number.  You can have different printers
   with the same model number but different parameters; this means
   printers that are functionally identical but have different ink
   characteristics.

   Each printer must have a unique driver name (even if the underlying
   driver is identical) to allow a unique mapping between driver
   name and printer name (the mapping is done both ways).

   NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: Printer names should not be translated into
   their equivalents (the same printer sold under a different name)
   in other countries.  The correct way to handle this is to add
   another printer to this list.  Translations should be done for
   e. g. character sets.

   For example, a Japanese printer will have the same model name wherever
   it is used and with whatever language the user speaks.
