# Executables from the Android SDK normally each staticly link in all
# of the libs.  That means each executable includes a full copy of all
# the libs, which is not how Debian works.  These libs need to be
# dynamically linlked in so that just the library can be updated when
# there is a security fix, instead of requiring all of the executables
# be recompiled.  That said, these libraries do not have a stable
# interface and were never intended to be used by any other project,
# only with the internal, Android SDK executables.  Therefore, the
# Android SDK executables use private libraries located in
# /usr/lib/android
