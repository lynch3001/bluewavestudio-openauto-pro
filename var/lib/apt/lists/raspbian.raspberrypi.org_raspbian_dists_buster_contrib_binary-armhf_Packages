 data for biologists and bioinformaticians. For example, it can transform
 original FASTA files into BLAST indexes. It is very flexible and its
 post-processing facilities can be extended very easily.
 .
 BioMAJ watcher provides a management interface for the BioMAJ tool.
 It runs in a web container (Tomcat) and is accessible under the URL
 http://hostname:portnumber/BmajWatcher
 .
 The web interface can give anonymous users an overview of available
 data. Administrators can also use it to manage data-banks, schedule
 updates via cron, view error logs, or use the integrated data-bank
 properties editor.

Description: metapackage for AMD/ATI OpenCL-savvy BOINC client and manager
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 Regular users (righteously) often find it an unbearable nuisance to
 care for the configuration of BOINC for the OpenCL-savvy AMD/ATI
 graphics cards.  This package adds a series of dependencies from the
 non-free section to the regular boinc package. This also meant this
 binary package to be redistributed in the contrib section of Debian.

 The engine uses context-sensitive rules to produce phonemes from the text. It
 relies on MBROLA to generate actual audio output from the phonemes. The TTS
 engine is implemented using the Python programming language.
 .
 The upstream authors have come up with this TTS to try and meet their own needs
 as blind users.
 It's designed to be plugged as output to some screen-review software, firstly
 with BRLTTY.
 They favor speed and intelligibility over perfect pronunciation.
 Cicero is aimed to have a quick response time, the ability to quickly shut-up
 and skip to another utterance, intelligibility where it counts (not perfect
 pronunciation), the ability to track speech progression, relative simplicity
 (hackability) and relative small code size.

Description: Common Lisp the Language, second edition, book (Pre-ANSI)
 This package installs the HTML version of Guy L. Steele book Common
 Lisp the Language, second edition. This book describes a snapshot of
 the Common Lisp language during the period that the ANSI Common
 Lisp standard was created. Thus, this book describe a NON-STANDARD
 version of Common Lisp which is similar to, but is *NOT*, ANSI
 Common Lisp.
 .
 For reference on ANSI Common Lisp, use the Debian package
 "hyperspec".  This book is included in Debian because, while it does
 differ from the ANSI standard, it has more details than the "hyperspec"
 about the design and usage of Lisp.
 .
 This package does not contain the actual HTML files, but rather
 downloads the HTML archive from the Internet and then installs it.

Description: distributed social networking service
 Diaspora (currently styled diaspora* and formerly styled DIASPORA*) is a free
 personal web server that implements a distributed social networking service.
 Installations of the software form nodes (termed "pods") which make up the
 distributed Diaspora social network.
 .
 Diaspora is intended to address privacy concerns related to centralized
 social networks by allowing users set up their own server (or "pod") to
 host content; pods can then interact to share status updates, photographs,
 and other social data. It allows its users to host their data with a
 traditional web host, a cloud-based host, an ISP, or a friend. The framework,
 which is being built on Ruby on Rails, is free software and can be
 experimented with by external developers.
 .

 This package configures PostgreSQL as the database and Nginx as the web server.

Description: Cisco 7200 Router Emulator Command Line Interface
 Dynagen is a text-based front end for Dynamips, that uses the
 Hypervisor mode for communication with Dynamips. Dynagen simplifies
 building and working with virtual networks:
  * Uses a simple, easy to understand configuration file for specifying
    virtual router hardware configurations
  * Simple syntax for interconnecting routers, bridges, frame-relay and
    ATM switches. No need to deal with NetIOs
  * Can work in a client / server mode, with Dynagen running on your
    workstation communicating to Dynamips running on a back-end server.
    Dynagen can also control multiple Dynamips servers simultaneously for
    distributing large virtual networks across several machines.
  * Provides a management CLI for listing devices, starting, stopping,
    reloading, suspending, and resuming virtual routers.

Description: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them using
 the existing MATLAB installation.

Description: PDP-8 Engineering and Scientific Interpreter eXtended
 ESI-X was the first stored program scientific interpreter
 for the PDP-8.
 ESI was designed by Dave Waks on 8/3/66 and was vaguely based on
 RAND's JOSS.
 In 1967 Bob Supnik extended the program to support 8KW of memory,
 and this became the "ESI-extended" or ESI-X
 FOCAL was eventually the successor of ESI-X.

 fheroes2: implementation of classic game Heroes of Might and Magic II.
 Heroes of Might and Magic II is a classic fantasy turn-based
 strategy/role-playing game which takes place in the land of Enroth,
 a place of magic.
 There are a multitude of creature types, from griffins to rocs,
 golems to pikemen, unicorns to hydras, and four different dragons.
 Each castle type has six different creatures, from the weak
 to the strong. There are six castle types, each corresponding to
 a hero class: Knight, Sorceress, Wizard (Good side), Barbarian,
 Necromancer and Warlock (Evil side). There are also six different
 types of neutral creatures you can recruit in special structures
 scattered about the maps.
 .
 Original game files from CD are needed to play this game.

Description: GeoLite binary database (downloader)
 GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find the country that any IP
 address or hostname originates from. It uses a file-based database.
 .
 This package contains a script that downloads the latest version of the binary
 flavor of the four MaxMind GeoLite databases (Country, IPv6 Country, City, and
 ASN).
 .
 These databases simply contain IP blocks as keys, and countries/cities/ASNs as
 values, which should be more complete and accurate than using reverse DNS
 lookups.
 .
 The MaxMind database itself is made available under a DFSG-compatible license.
 However, it is distributed directly in binary format and the source code for
 generating it is not provided.

Description: Graphical Network Simulator
 GNS3 is a graphical network simulator that allows simulation of
 complex networks and to launch simulations on them. It is an excellent
 complementary tool to real labs for administrators of Cisco networks
 or people wanting to pass their CCNA, CCNP, CCIP or CCIE certifications.
 It can also be used to experiment with features of Cisco IOS or to check
 configurations that need to be deployed later on real routers.
 .
 You may configure devices ranging from Cisco routers, Cisco PIX firewalls,
 Cisco ASA Firewalls, Cisco IDS to JunOS routers using Qemu or Pemu. GNS3
 uses dynamips as an emulation back end, an IOS emulator which allows users
 to run IOS binary images from Cisco Systems.
 .
 Cisco IOS, PIX, ASA or JunOS software images are not included.

Description: Android SDK Documentation from Google
 This package will download the Android SDK Documentation from Google and
 create a Debian package.  This package also aims to strip out all calls to
 the networking, including tracking services like Google Analytics and
 Doubleclick. These documentation files still require the Google "jsapi",
 which is only available by fetching it each time from
 http://www.google.com/jsapi.  This package forces it to use https://, but
 otherwise, these docs have to phone home in order for any of the javascript
 to work.
 .
 WARNING: Installing this Debian package causes docs-24_r01.zip to be
 downloaded from https://dl.google.com and/or from other suggested
 mirrors.  Also, since Google is often blocked in China, the install
 process will try again on Chinese mirrors if the Google central
 download repo is not available.  Since the zipball is checked against
 the embedded SHA1 checksum, the install will fail if the mirror
 contains a corrupted version.

 2.5 license is non-free but can be legally distributed by Debian.

Description: utility to automatically build a Debian package of Google Earth
 Google Earth is a 3D planet viewer that lets you interactively navigate
 satellite imagery, maps, terrain, and so forth.
 .
 Google Earth is available for GNU/Linux from their web site, but is
 non-free software and is undistributable. It also does not integrate
 well into a Debian system.
 .
 This utility makes it possible to build your own personal Debian
 package of Google Earth. The packaging itself is Free Software, but
 the Google Earth program is governed by the copyright holder (Google),
 so you may be limited as to what you can do with the resulting
 package (i.e. no redistribution, etc). This package will simply help
 you create the package, it is your responsibility to use the resulting
 package responsibly.

Description: Java library for developing numerical applications (documentation)
 MTJ is designed to be used as a library for developing numerical
 applications, both for small and large scale computations. The library
 is based on BLAS and LAPACK for its dense and structured sparse
 computations, and on the Templates project for unstructured sparse
 operations.
 .
 MTJ uses the netlib-java project as a backend, which can be set up to
 use machine-optimised BLAS libraries for improved performance of dense
 matrix operations, falling back to a pure Java implementation. This
 ensures perfect portability, while allowing for improved performance in
 a production environment.
 .
 This package contains the javadoc documentation files.

Description: firmware files used by the linux-wlan-ng driver
 linux-wlan-ng is a set of drivers and utilities that is intended to
 provide the full range of IEEE 802.11 MAC management capabilities for use
 in user-mode utilities and scripts. The package currently supports the
 Intersil 802.11b Prism2, Prism2.5, and Prism3 reference designs for
 PCMCIA, PCI, and USB. Additionally, the package includes support for the
 PLX9052 based PCI to PCMCIA adapter with a few different PCMCIA cards.
 .
 This package doesn't contain the firmware files, but a script to download
 the upstream source tarball and build a deb that contains them. Note that
 only some adapters really need a firmware file and that firmware files are
 not completely free (in the sense of freely redistributable), that's why
 this package exists.
 .
 For newer kernels (2.6.31+) which have the in-tree prism2_usb driver,
 you can install the prism2-usb-firmware-installer package instead.

Description: Homebrew package manager for Linux
 Linuxbrew is a fork of Homebrew, the Mac OS package manager, for Linux.
 .
 It can be installed in your home directory and does not require root
 access. The same package manager can be used on both your Linux server
 and your Mac laptop. Installing a modern version of glibc and gcc in
 your home directory on an old distribution of Linux takes five minutes.
 .
 Features:
  * Can install software to a home directory and so does not require sudo
  * Install software not packaged by the native distribution
  * Install up-to-date versions of software when the native distribution is old
  * Use the same package manager to manage both your Mac and Linux machines
 .
 This package provides Linuxbrew install scripts instead of linuxbrew itself.

 installed via ./play.it is indistinguishable from a game installed via the
 official repositories of your favorite distribution.
 .
 The games are installed globally on multi-user systems, avoiding unnecessary
 duplication. The locations of save games, settings, mods, temporary files and
 backups are standardized with XDG Base Directory support.
 .
 Packaging the games simplifies future updates, uninstalls and handling of any
 necessary dependencies, including integrated obsolete dependencies if specific
 versions are needed.

 the upstream website, combines it with Debian packaging information
 from the package maintainer's website; then builds a publicfile Debian
 package, and installs that. When installing this installer package,
 one is given the option to postpone downloading and installing

Description: module to access Nvidia‘s CUDA computation API (documentation)
 PyCUDA lets you access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API from Python.
 Several wrappers of the CUDA API already exist–so what’s so special about
 PyCUDA?
  * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called
    RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free
    code.  PyCUDA knows about dependencies, too, so (for example) it won’t
    detach from a context before all memory allocated in it is also freed.
  * Convenience. Abstractions like pycuda.driver.SourceModule and
    pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray make CUDA programming even more convenient than
    with Nvidia’s C-based runtime.
  * Completeness. PyCUDA puts the full power of CUDA’s driver API at your
    disposal, if you wish.
  * Automatic Error Checking. All CUDA errors are automatically translated
    into Python exceptions.
  * Speed. PyCUDA’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties
    above are virtually free.
  * Helpful Documentation.
 .
 This package contains HTML documentation and example scripts.

Description: preparation of in silico drug screening projects
 The field of computational biology is all about modeling
 physiochemical entities. Structural biology is about how
 those entities look in 3D and behave. Assume a specific
 behaviour (and only this) of a drug can be changed in a
 defined way.
 .
 Some good part of the characterisation of promising
 drug-like compounds for their interaction with a larger protein
 can be done on computers. This package helps with getting
 collections of small ligands prepared to be fitted against
 a particular protein of known structure. That docking itself
 is then to be performed by autodock or autodock-vina.
 .
 Raccoon may not find the drug, but it may well find a
 lead to it. To have this package with Debian shall help
 smaller biochemistry labs and grants an opportunity for the
 general public to educate itself and/or actively join in to
 help the world .... just a bit.

Description: repository management tool built on top of git
 Repo is a repository management tool that the Android developers built on top
 of Git. Repo unifies the many Git repositories when necessary, does the
 uploads to the Android revision control system, and automates parts of the
 Android development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make
 it easier to work with Git in the context of Android. The repo command is an
 executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path. In working
 with the Android source files, you will use Repo for across-network
 operations. For example, with a single Repo command you can download files
 from multiple repositories into your local working directory.
 .
 repo is an unusual tool because it downloads all of its own Python modules
 using GPG-signed git tags, and stores those files as part of the project that
 it is working with.  So this package just provides the wrapper script, which
 provides the GPG signing keys for verifying that the correct Python code was
 downloaded.

Description: Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line Debian package builder
 This utility makes it possible to build a Debian package from Oracle SQL
 Developer Command-Line (SQLcl). The Oracle SQL Developer program is governed
 by the copyright holder (Oracle USA, Inc.), so you may be limited as to what
 you can do with the resulting package (i.e. no redistribution, etc). This
 utility will simply help you create the Debian package, it is your
 responsibility to use the resulting package accordingly with the OTN license,
 a copy of which is included in the created package, that you must agree on
 when downloading the source.
 .
 This utility will require you to download the architecture independent archive
 from <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sqlcl/overview>,
 identified as "Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line for All Platforms", to create
 the Debian package from.
 .
 Due to a conflicting name with content of package "parallel" the upstream
 binary "sql" will be renamed. Multiple versions can coexist so
 "sql.[upstream version].standalone" will invoke a specific version of
 Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line, "sql.[upstram version]" will invoke
 either the standalone or bundled Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line version
 (in this order), while "sqlcl" (the recommended way) and
 "sqlcl.standalone" take advantage of Debian's alternatives system and,
 when left in auto mode, will always invoke the highest version installed.

Description: Etoys activity for Sugar Learning Platform
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
 packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
 instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
 Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
 be invited to join a collective Activity session.
 .
 Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and
 starLOGO. It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple,
 powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by
 end-users. It includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles,
 presentations, web-pages, videos, sound and MIDI, etc. It includes the
 ability to share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so many
 forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet.
 .
 The Etoys activity embeds Squeak Etoys into Sugar.
